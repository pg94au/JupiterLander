The first game I wrote for the Commodore Amiga.  At the time I was using SAS/C 6.0 on a Commodore Amiga 2000 with an IVS Vector 030 with a 25MHz 68030, a total of 5MB of RAM and a 120MB hard disk.

This was written a long time ago.  I haven't used my Amiga for a very long time, but I did still have this code lying around and I figure this is a reasonable home for it.

It is not being maintained.  :-)
